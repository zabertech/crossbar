An unmatched rule means that we expected the rule to match with a URI to existing on the nexus server. That this error popped up might mean something as simple as the URI's host just got rebooted or even that a service for some reason has fallen off and become inaccessible.

{% for rule in unmatched_rules -%}{% if rule.match -%}
	- Match: {{ rule.match }}

Unmatched registrations are caused when there is no rule that matches a particular URI on the server. This might mean that a new service has gone up, or possibly a rogue service has been hooked.

The list is given such that that there is the unaccounted URI and the number of callees attached to that URI.
